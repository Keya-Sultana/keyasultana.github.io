        <h1>👋 About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a Senior Odoo Developer with strong experience in designing, developing, and customizing Odoo ERP solutions for diverse business needs. I have successfully implemented Odoo across multiple industries, helping organizations automate workflows, streamline operations, and improve productivity.

My expertise includes custom module development, API integrations, QWeb/PDF reports, and third-party integrations such as payment gateways, SMS services, and accounting platforms. I have a solid command of Python, Odoo ORM, QWeb, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL, enabling me to deliver reliable backend and frontend solutions.

I specialize in scalable Odoo architectures, system upgrades, performance optimization, and server deployment, providing complete end-to-end ERP solutions. I am always open to new projects, collaborations, and long-term opportunities where I can help businesses grow through efficient Odoo implementations.
